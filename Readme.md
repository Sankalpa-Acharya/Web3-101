# Getting Started

⚠️ These resources are not just random picks from the internet; I have added the resources that I'm using to learn web3 Development.

### Prerequisite
- Basics of Web Development

### Concepts 
Before you start writing code, you must have an idea of what you are doing, what you want to develop, what problems web3 is trying to solve, and how things work. Therefore, it is necessary to have your fundamentals clear.

# Learning Solidity
Solidity is a statically-typed programming language designed for developing smart contracts that run on Ethereum.

[Crypto Zombies](https://cryptozombies.io/en/solidity) is a great website for learning Solidity with hands-on experience. [Solving Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERAxd8gl1Eg&t=7079s). I suggest you do it by yourself and watch this video too(2-3 min of each chapter, then you start doing it by yourself) because in this video, he is comparing game concepts with real-world scenarios.

You can find the Solidity Code for Crypto Zombies Chapaters in this repo.

## Solidity Security
